## 0. Basic Concepts

### Packet Tracer File Types
- `.pka` == Activity (instructions, scoring...)
- `.pkt` == standard
- `.pksz` == Tutored Activities
- `.pkz` == deprecated!

### Determine End-Device IP Addresses
1. Logical > Device > Config > FastEthernet
2. Logical > Device > Desktop > Terminal-CMD > `ipconfig`-`ifconfig`


## 1. Packet Tracer - Logical and Physical Mode Exploration

> [2.1-logical-and-physical-mode-exploration-spanish.pksz](/ASIR+/CCNA-Bombal/2-CiscoIntroCourse/2.1-logical-and-physical-mode-exploration.pksz)

### Objectives
- Investigate Devices in a Wiring Closet
- Connect End Devices to Networking Devices
- Install a Backup Router
- Configure a Hostname

### Background / Scenario
The network model in this Packet Tracer Tutored Activity (PTTA) incorporates many of the technologies that you can master in Cisco Networking Academy courses. It represents a simplified version of how a small to medium-sized business network might look.

Most of the devices in the Seward Branch Office (top left) and Warrenton (bottom right) data center are already deployed and configured. You have just been hired to review the devices and networks deployed. It is not important that you understand everything you see and do in this activity. Feel free to explore the network and become familiar with the menus on your own. Hints will also appear after a certain amount of time. You can select a hint level with the slider bar in the bottom left hand corner.

**Note**: There are two way to look at a network in Packet Tracer. **Logical** mode shows you how devices are connected in the network. **Physical** mode shows you where the devices are located in the network. This activity opens in and focuses on **Physical** mode. Many of the Packet Tracer activities you encounter in Cisco Networking Academy courses will use **Logical** mode. You can switch between these modes at any time to compare the differences by clicking the **Logical** (Shift-L) and **Physical** (Shift-P) buttons. However, in other activities in this course you may be locked out of one mode or the other.

## 2. Packet Tracer - Create a Simple Network

### Objectives
In this activity, you will build a simple network in Packet Tracer in the Logical Workspace.
- Part 1: Build a Simple Network
- Part 2: Configure the End Devices and Verify Connectivity

> **NOTE**: For the first `ping` task, we activate **Simulation** mode to track tha packets!
