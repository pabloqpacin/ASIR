> i have a windows server virtual machine. what do i need to do to manage active directory? im proficient in linux system administration 

To manage Active Directory on a Windows Server virtual machine, you'll need to use the tools provided by Microsoft. Here are the basic steps to get started:

1. **Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):**
   - Open Server Manager on your Windows Server VM.
   - Click on "Add roles and features."
   - Select "Active Directory Domain Services" as the role to install.
   - Follow the wizard to complete the installation.

2. **Promote the Server to a Domain Controller:**
   - After installing AD DS, you'll need to promote the server to a domain controller.
   - The Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard will guide you through the process.
   - During the promotion, you'll be asked to provide a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password.

3. **Install RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) on a Windows Client (Optional):**
   - If you prefer managing Active Directory from a remote Windows machine, you can install RSAT.
   - Download and install RSAT from the Microsoft website.
   - Enable the Active Directory tools within RSAT.

4. **Manage Active Directory:**
   - Once the server is promoted, you can use the "Active Directory Users and Computers" (ADUC) console to manage users, groups, and organizational units.
   - You can also use other tools like "Active Directory Sites and Services" for site management and "Active Directory Domains and Trusts" for trust management.

5. **Use PowerShell for Automation:**
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool for managing Active Directory. Make sure you have the Active Directory module installed.
   - You can perform various tasks using PowerShell cmdlets such as `Get-ADUser`, `New-ADUser`, `Get-ADGroup`, etc.

6. **Security Considerations:**
   - Understand and implement security best practices for Active Directory.
   - Regularly back up Active Directory data, including system state.

Remember that Active Directory is a critical component of your Windows environment, so changes should be made carefully and with a good understanding of the implications.

If you're proficient in Linux, managing Active Directory might have a learning curve, but with time, you'll become familiar with the tools and processes. Feel free to ask if you have specific questions or encounter any issues during the setup or management process.

> please provide all steps in powershell portable code

Certainly! Below are PowerShell commands that you can use to perform the steps mentioned earlier. Note that some steps might require elevated privileges, so ensure you run PowerShell as an administrator.

1. **Install Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):**
```powershell
Get-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services

Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
```

2. **Promote the Server to a Domain Controller:**

<!-- ```ps1
# Check if the server is already a domain controller
$domainController = Get-ADDomainController -Discover -Service "PrimaryDC"

if ($domainController) {
    Write-Host "The server is already a domain controller:"
    $domainController
} else {
    Write-Host "The server is not yet a domain controller. Proceeding with promotion..."
    # Proceed with the promotion command
    Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "yourdomain.local" -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "YourDSRMPassword" -Force) -DomainMode Win2019 -ForestMode Win2019
}
``` -->

```powershell
Get-ADDomainController -Discover -Service "PrimaryDC"

# Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "yourdomain.local" -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "YourDSRMPassword" -Force) -DomainMode Win2019 -ForestMode Win2019

Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "homelab.local" -SafeModeAdministratorPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "ComplexPassword123" -Force) -DomainMode Default -ForestMode Default
```

Replace "yourdomain.local" with your desired domain name and set a secure password for DSRM.

1. **Install RSAT on a Windows Client (Optional):**
   - Download RSAT from Microsoft: [Remote Server Administration Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520)
   - Enable AD tools within RSAT.

2. **Manage Active Directory using PowerShell:**
   - Open a PowerShell session and import the Active Directory module.
```powershell
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
```
   - Use various cmdlets to manage Active Directory. For example:
```powershell
# Get information about the domain
Get-ADDomain

# Create a new user
New-ADUser -SamAccountName "NewUser" -UserPrincipalName "NewUser@yourdomain.local" -GivenName "John" -Surname "Doe" -Enabled $true

# Add user to a group
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "GroupName" -Members "NewUser"
```

5. **Security Considerations:**
   - Regularly back up Active Directory data, including system state.
```powershell
Backup-ADForest -DirectoryPath "C:\Backup" -BackupMethod Full
```

These commands provide a basic setup and management for Active Directory using PowerShell. Make sure to customize the commands according to your specific requirements. Also, always check Microsoft's documentation for the latest recommendations and best practices related to Active Directory management.

> should the virtual machine have any specific network configuration (eg. dhcp/dns server or rather just a host on the network)?


Yes, the virtual machine running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) typically requires specific network configurations to function properly. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Static IP Address:**
   - It's recommended to assign a static IP address to the virtual machine rather than relying on DHCP. This ensures that the IP address of the domain controller remains consistent.

2. **DNS Configuration:**
   - The domain controller should use its own IP address as the primary DNS server in its network settings. This is crucial for AD DS to function correctly. If you have more than one domain controller, you can use the IP address of another domain controller as the secondary DNS server.

3. **DNS Server Role:**
   - The domain controller itself should be running the DNS Server role. During the installation of AD DS, you will be prompted to install DNS if it's not already present.

4. **Network Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that the virtual machine has proper network connectivity to the rest of the network. It should be able to communicate with other domain controllers, clients, and any other servers in the environment.

5. **Firewall Settings:**
   - If there are firewalls between the domain controller and other network resources, make sure the necessary ports are open for Active Directory communication. Microsoft provides documentation on the required ports.

Here's a brief example of how you might configure the network settings using PowerShell:

```powershell
# Set a static IP address
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -IPAddress "192.168.1.2" -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway "192.168.1.1"

# Set the DNS server to localhost (assuming DNS is running on the domain controller)
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet" -ServerAddresses "127.0.0.1"

# Restart the network adapter for changes to take effect
Restart-NetAdapter -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet"
```

Make sure to adapt the IP addresses and interface names according to your network configuration.

These are general guidelines, and the specific requirements may vary based on your network architecture and policies. Always refer to Microsoft's documentation and best practices for setting up Active Directory in your environment.

> how to use `get-aduser`


The `Get-ADUser` cmdlet is used to retrieve information about Active Directory users. Here's how you can use it and some common examples:

1. **Basic Usage:**
   - To get information about a specific user, you can use the `-Identity` parameter with the user's username, DistinguishedName, or another identifier.
     ```powershell
     Get-ADUser -Identity "JohnDoe"
     ```

2. **Retrieve All Users:**
   - To retrieve information about all users in the domain, simply run:
     ```powershell
     Get-ADUser -Filter *
     ```

3. **Filter Users Based on Criteria:**
   - You can use the `-Filter` parameter to retrieve users based on specific criteria. For example, to get all users whose names start with "John":
     ```powershell
     Get-ADUser -Filter {GivenName -like 'John*'}
     ```

4. **Select Specific Properties:**
   - You can use the `-Properties` parameter to select specific properties of users. For example, to get only the username and email address:
     ```powershell
     Get-ADUser -Identity "JohnDoe" -Properties SamAccountName, EmailAddress
     ```

5. **Search Users in a Specific Organizational Unit (OU):**
   - To limit the search to a specific Organizational Unit, you can use the `-SearchBase` parameter:
     ```powershell
     Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "
